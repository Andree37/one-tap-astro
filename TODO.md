4. this game will be a vertical vampire survivors
15. add a song in the background
16. there is kind of a bug with the going up and the score and the xp. I think its related to the game going down. Or maybe because there is no more counting after we reach level 2? this is wrong we should forever count. the bar disappear when i opened the loot box after getting to level 2.
17. the powerups should be more permanent
18. add boss song
19. the enemies are just floating up, realistically they should be kinda trying to pull you down. And you should be able to kill the enemies by landing on their head. And if you do you do like a little jump bounce from them.
